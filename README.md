# Assessment of malaria parasitemia from Giemsa-stained blood smears.

## Description
This project aims to aid the assessment of the parasitemia, i.e. # infected red blood cells / # all red blood cells in optical microscopic images of blood smears from malaria cell cultures. Initially, a watershed algorithm and edge detection filters are applied for an algorithmic segmentation of the red blood cells in the images. In the future, machine learning models (CNN with YOLO) will be tested for a better result.
